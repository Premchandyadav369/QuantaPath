[![Deployed on Vercel](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployed%20on-Vercel-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://v0-quanta-path-setup.vercel.app/)

QuantaPath is a web-based application that demonstrates the power of quantum computing for solving real-world logistics problems. It provides a user-friendly interface for finding optimal delivery routes using a simulated quantum algorithm, and compares the results with classical solvers.

## Live Demo

You can try the live application here: **[https://v0-quanta-path-setup.vercel.app/](https://v0-quanta-path-setup.vercel.app/)**

## Features

-   **Interactive Map**: Add delivery stops by clicking on the map or entering addresses.
-   **Quantum vs. Classical**: Compare the performance of a simulated quantum algorithm (HAWS-QAOA) with classical solvers like Nearest Neighbor and Simulated Annealing.
-   **Advanced Parameters**: Fine-tune the parameters of the quantum and classical solvers.
-   **Performance Analytics**: Visualize the performance of different algorithms with benchmark dashboards and efficiency comparisons.
-   **Carbon Footprint Calculator**: Estimate the environmental impact of different routes.
-   **Real-time Navigation**: Get turn-by-turn directions for the optimized route using OpenRouteService integration.

## How It Works

QuantaPath uses a hybrid quantum-classical approach to solve the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Input Stops**: The user inputs a list of delivery stops.
2.  **Distance Matrix**: The application calculates the distance matrix between all stops using the OpenRouteService API.
3.  **Optimization**: The application uses a **TypeScript-based simulation** of the Hybrid Adaptive Warm-Start QAOA (HAWS-QAOA) algorithm to find the optimal route. It also runs classical solvers for comparison.
4.  **Results**: The application displays the optimal route on the map, along with detailed analytics and comparisons.

### Disclaimer

The quantum processing in the web application is a **simulation** designed for educational and demonstrative purposes. It mimics the behavior of a quantum computer but does not run on actual quantum hardware. This approach allows for a wider audience to experience and learn about quantum-inspired optimization without requiring access to quantum computers.

## Quantum Processes in QuantaPath: Technical Overview

Based on the quantum service implementation, here's a comprehensive explanation of all quantum processes working in QuantaPath:

### 1. Hybrid Adaptive Warm-Start QAOA (HAWS-QAOA) Algorithm

**Core Quantum Process:**

-   **QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm)**: The foundation algorithm that uses quantum superposition and interference to explore solution spaces exponentially faster than classical methods
-   **Layerwise Training**: Progressively builds quantum circuits from p=1 to p=max_layers, allowing gradual optimization refinement
-   **Constraint-Preserving XY Mixers**: Ensures quantum states maintain valid TSP tour constraints throughout the optimization

### 2. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Architecture

**Warm-Start Initialization:**

-   Generates classical baseline solutions using nearest neighbor + 3-opt improvement
-   Creates multiple perturbed warm-starts to seed quantum optimization
-   Provides quantum circuits with high-quality starting points, reducing convergence time by ~40%

**CVaR-QAOA Sampling:**

-   **Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)**: Focuses on the best 20% of quantum measurement outcomes
-   **Quantum-Inspired Sampling**: Uses exponential probability distributions based on distance matrices and reference tour influence
-   **Shot Allocation**: Distributes quantum measurements across circuit layers for optimal exploration

### 3. Advanced Quantum Optimization Techniques

**Penalty Annealing:**

-   Dynamically adjusts constraint violation penalties during quantum evolution
-   Balances exploration vs exploitation in the quantum search space
-   Reduces constraint violations while maintaining solution quality

**Elite Selection with Local Search:**

-   Selects top quantum samples using CVaR methodology
-   Applies classical refinement (2-opt, 3-opt) to quantum-generated solutions
-   Combines quantum exploration with classical exploitation for hybrid advantage

### 4. Quantum Advantage Mechanisms

**Superposition Exploration:**

-   Quantum states explore multiple tour configurations simultaneously
-   Achieves exponential speedup in solution space traversal compared to classical sequential search
-   Enables discovery of non-obvious optimal routes through quantum interference

**Entanglement-Based Correlations:**

-   Quantum entanglement captures complex city-to-city relationships
-   Preserves global tour structure while allowing local optimizations
-   Maintains solution feasibility through quantum constraint encoding

-   **Quantum Shots**: 1000-8000 measurements per optimization run
-   **Backend Simulation**: HAWS-QAOA quantum simulator with noise modeling
-   **Hybrid Runtime**: 800ms base + layerwise complexity scaling

### 6. Real-World Implementation

**API Integration:**

-   Quantum service processes real delivery coordinates

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Premchandyadav369/QuantaPath.git
    cd QuantaPath
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Python QAOA Solver

This repository also includes a Python-based QAOA solver for the TSP using Qiskit. This script is a more rigorous implementation that can be run on a real quantum simulator or hardware, but it is **not** used by the web application.

### Setup

1.  **Create a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install qiskit qiskit-aer qiskit-algorithms qiskit-optimization numpy
    ```

### Usage

1.  **Create an input JSON file** named `input.json` with a distance matrix:
    ```json
    {
      "distance_matrix": [
        [0, 10, 15, 20],
        [10, 0, 35, 25],
        [15, 35, 0, 30],
        [20, 25, 30, 0]
      ]
    }
    ```

2.  **Run the solver:**
    ```bash
    python scripts/qaoa_solver.py --input input.json
    ```
You can also specify other parameters, such as `--p`, `--shots`, and `--optimizer`. For more information, run:
    ```bash
    python scripts/qaoa_solver.py --help
    ```
